# pdf_margin_extender
Website built using GPTo4 generated code. Input pdf file/s and output as images in a single pptx. Choose slide background color, image shrink rate and placement of the image (although you can also do so by editing the output pptx file). 

Pros = You can make notes around your pdf page. No such online tool exists and it saves you a few seconds of screenshoting every pdf page, pasting it onto a ppt slide and resizing it.

Cons = only works for pdf - ppt conversion. Input file/s size limited to 200mb.
